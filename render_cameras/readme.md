# Blender Camera Render Scripts

A set of simple Blender Python scripts to automate rendering from multiple cameras.

## Usage

- Each script automates rendering animations from cameras that have keyframes.
- Renders saved in folders named by camera under `Camera_Renders/`.

## Notes

- Skips cameras with no keyframes or hidden from render.
- Remember to set output path in Blender before running.
